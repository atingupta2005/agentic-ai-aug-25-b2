    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook provides a detailed, beginner-friendly guide to building your first AI Agent using the LangChain framework. An AI Agent can do more than just chat; it can use **tools** to interact with the outside world, look up information, and perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Objectives:\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have:\n",
    "1.  **Set up** a Python environment with LangChain and connected it to an LLM (OpenAI).\n",
    "2.  **Created and tested custom tools** for the agent (Wikipedia Search and a Calculator).\n",
    "3.  **Built an Agent** that can intelligently decide which tool to use based on your question.\n",
    "4.  **Added Memory** to the agent so it can remember previous parts of your conversation.\n",
    "5.  **Observed the agent's reasoning process** step-by-step."

At the average surface level the atmospheric pressure is a few thousandths of Earth's, atmospheric temperature ranges from ‚àí153 to 20¬†¬∞C and cosmic radiation is high.

    "#### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1.  **Agents = LLM (Brain) + Tools (Actions)**: The core idea is to give a language model the ability to interact with external systems.\n",
    "2.  **Tool Descriptions are Crucial**: The agent decides which tool to use based on the `description` you provide. Make them clear and specific.\n",
    "3.  **Memory Enables Conversation**: Without memory, each query is isolated. Memory provides context for follow-up questions.\n",
    "4.  **`verbose=True` is Your Best Friend**: It's essential for understanding and debugging the agent's reasoning process."
